## What are Bose Frames?

Imagine you took a pair of bluetooth earphones and a pair of glasses then smushed them together. The end result would be the Bose Frames. They're a slightly oversized but otherwise normal looking pair of sunglasses made of nylon but in each arm is a speaker and a bit of electronics. The speakers fire downwards towards your ears without blocking them so you can still hear your surroundings which is extremely useful while cycling or jogging. The sound quality is pretty good, comparable to a pair of wired earbuds that rest in your ear rather than wedging in your ear canal. It's a little lacking in bass but mid and high ranges are good and you could happily listen to music via them. You couldn't listen for very long though as the battery life on the first generation is about 3 hours of playback and they can't be used while charging. 

I bought a pair of Altos back in January 2020 and had them fitted with prescription lenses by a local optician (Seen Optician in Manchester UK, excellent service). I used them as my daily wear glasses until a few months back they stopped working, the ribbon cable connecting the left and right sides had snapped, and while they were under warranty COVID had kicked off and I didn't feel like sending my glasses off for who knows how long. Today I got a bit bored and decided to crack them open to see if I could repair them myself.

## The teardown

### Left arm
![Bose Frames left arm](images/teardown/left-arm.jpg)
The left arm has two nylon parts, a moulded shell and a plate that glues to the shell. If you are wearing the glasses the plate is closest to your head. The hinge end is partially open so I recommend prying there gently. Be careful not to pry too deeply as there's a lithium ion battery inside. There are no clips holding the plate in. While nylon is flexible the glue is strong enough to bend or snap the plate so cut the glue as you go.

On the inside of the plate there's the remnants of some glue that helps to form an acoustic chamber for the speaker, along with some foam to hold the battery in place.

This bit of the plate attempts to stop dust and pry-tool ingress. I think the Bose Frames have a water resistance rating but it's likely low. I feel bad for taking mine in the shower.

The left arm contains a 0.4Wh lithium ion pouch battery, a speaker, and some mouldings that combine with glue to make a sealed acoustic chamber. I'm sure Bose put a lot of time and effort into those mouldings.

It's a little hard to see but there's three sections to the acoustic chamber. I think the long section connects to the space in front of the speaker while the small triangular section connects to the back of the speeaker. That would fit with three ear-facing speaker grilles on the bottom of the arm and one outward-facing grille roughly where that triangular section is.

TODO: ribbon cable, right arm. See images directory for pictures ahead of a write-up.

## So what next?
### Situation
That ribbon cable has snapped at a really awkward point. I don't think I can solder onto it to get the Frames working again and even if I could I'm not sure the fix would last very long. These arms get folded in every night so the ribbon cable sees a lot of wear and tear. That said I think there could have been a little bit more slack on the hinge side of my cable, I suspect there was a tiny manufacturing fault as the cable looks hand-fitted. Not that it matters, my warranty is super void by this poiint.

### Ideas
I think the ribbon cable is enough of a design flaw that I don't want to repeat it. What about...
- True Wireless Earphones, could stuff one earphone into each side
  - but how would they charge?
  - Are they small enough?
  - Can they handle the larger driver?
  - Bluetooth sync issues
  - Not the most flexible option
- Rip it all out, use them as dumb headphones
  - Did Bose need a hardware equaliser?
  - Case modifications
  - Maybe use xxcm connectors like IEM earphones do?
  - Cables are ugly...
  - Extremely flexible. Make them take a 3.5mm jack, use with bluetooth receiver, USB DAC etc.
  - Weight reductions
